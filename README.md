# SVM and Random Forest Genre Classifier of Drum Loops

The objective of this project is to take survey Machine Learning Models for the purpose of genre classifications.
The questions addressed in this project are:
1. What are Support Vector Machines (SVM)? What are the types of SVM?
2. What are the features that we can extract that constitutes drums?
3. How do we perform dimensionality reduction?
4. What is Random Forest?

# Methodology
## Dataset
A custom dataset was created using the [Waiveops](https://www.patchbanks.com/waivops/) dataset created by the people at Patchbanks.

## Model Setup

## Results
Achieved 83% Overall Accuracy
